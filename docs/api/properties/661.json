If an exception is specified as a [[DateTime]] then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time\n      should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a [[Date]] then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be\n      excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.",
